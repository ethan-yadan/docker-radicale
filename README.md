# Radicale Docker task 

Installing Radicale on Docker. 
Radicale is a small but powerful CalDAV (calendars, to-do lists) and CardDAV (contacts) server, that:

	* Shares calendars and contact lists through CalDAV, CardDAV and HTTP.
	* Supports events, todos, journal entries and business cards.
	* Works out-of-the-box, no complicated setup or configuration required.
	* Can limit access by authentication.
	* Can secure connections with TLS.
	* Works with many CalDAV and CardDAV clients.
	* Stores all data on the file system in a simple folder structure.
	* Can be extended with plugins.
	* Is GPLv3-licensed free software.
