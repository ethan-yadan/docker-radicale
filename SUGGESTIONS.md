# Suggestions

### Project
Nice work, although, not clear what is wrong with extentions. also, the task was to insert it into k8s not docker-compose.

### README
- Missing link to (it exist but not inserted in the README and )TASKS.md
- You need to polish your markdown (.md) syntax for proper documentation
- Pictures need to be in `assets` folder

### INSTALL SCRIPT

- Instructions are very clear, yet would you prefer to have instructions or ready-to-use script ?
- In-correct docker install commands
- what is the point installing radical if you are providing docker container of someone else ?

### DOCKER
- you are just copy pasting someone else container, thus did not invested in developing your own dockerfile and ...
  - 

### K8S
- does not exists
